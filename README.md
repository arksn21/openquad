TUTORIAL:

A two wheel drive differential bot with ultrasonic sensor.

Steps for running simulation: 
1)First create two work spaces named caktin_ws and simulation_ws 
2)create catkin packages inside catkin workspace: 
  1)go to catkin_ws/src
  2)create catkin package with dependencies:-1)geometry_msgs, 2)rospy, 3)sensor_msgs, 4)std_msgs and name "motion_plan"         3)copy the python files from motion plan inside this folder to catkin_ws/src/motion_plan you have built 
  4)open ternminal :
    1)cd ~/catkin_ws 
    2)catkin_make 
    3) source devel/setup.bash 
3)create catkin packages inside simulation workspace: 
  1)go to simulation_ws/src 
  2)create catkin package with dependency: urdf and name "m2wr_description" 
  3)copy the folder m2wr_description from simulation_ws/src inside this folder to simulation_ws/src you have built 
4) To run the simulation : 
  1)open two terminals: one for gazebo and another for launch file 
  2)In gazebo terminal launch world using: roslaunch gazebo_ros /name of world/ (For e.g. : roslaunch gazebo_ros                 empty_world.launch) 
  3)In another teminal: 1) cd ~/simulation_ws 2) source devel/setup.bash 3) roslaunch m2wr_description spawn.launch

At this point you should have launched robot in gazebo world

To run the object detection script

open another terminal
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/motion_plan/scripts
chmod +x 755 script_name(For e.g. chmod +x 755 python.py)
cd ~/catin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun motion_plan script_name(For e.g. rosrun motion_plan object_detection.py)
